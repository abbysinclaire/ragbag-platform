## Overview

Complex systems are everywhere - from ant colonies to economies to the internet. This is my first dive into understanding how they work.

## Key Concepts

**Emergence**: When simple rules create complex behaviors that can't be predicted from the parts alone.

**Self-organization**: Systems organize themselves without central control.

**Non-linearity**: Small changes can have big effects (butterfly effect).

## Examples I Found Interesting

- **Termite mounds**: Millions of termites following simple rules create sophisticated ventilation systems
- **Traffic jams**: Can appear spontaneously even without accidents or bottlenecks
- **Immune system**: No central controller, yet highly effective

## Questions This Raises

- How can we design systems that self-organize in beneficial ways?
- What are the limits of prediction in complex systems?
- Can we apply these principles to social organization?

## Next Steps

- Read *Thinking in Systems* by Donella Meadows
- Look into agent-based modeling
- Maybe connect this to Jordan's work on emergent patterns in music?
