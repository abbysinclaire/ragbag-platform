## What is Open Source Hardware?

Hardware whose design is made publicly available so anyone can study, modify, distribute, make, and sell it.

## Why It Matters

- **Democratizes technology** - Anyone can build professional-grade tools
- **Accelerates innovation** - Building on each other's work
- **Education** - Learn by studying real designs
- **Repair** - Right to fix your own stuff

## Cool Projects I Found

**Arduino**: The gateway drug of open hardware. Started it all for many makers.

**Open Source Ecology**: Building the "Global Village Construction Set" - 50 industrial machines needed to build a civilization.

**RepRap**: Self-replicating 3D printers. Mind-blowing concept.

**Pocket Science Lab**: Open source scientific instruments for education.

## Thoughts

This connects to our whole philosophy of learning from scratch. What if we built some of our own tools for research? Could be a great learning project.

Maybe we should look into building:
- A simple oscilloscope
- Environmental sensors
- Audio analysis tools for my music project
