## My Seasonal Project: Rhythm and synchronization across scales

How do systems 'listen' to each other across scales, and can designed interfaces make this coupling visible, audible, and tangible?

### Week 1-3: Research Phase
- Capture oscillations in living systems (plant bioelectricity, microbial growth patterns, heartbeat variability)
- Document sync phenomena (metronomes, pendulums, human breathing/walking in groups)
- Track environmental rhythms  (tidal, circadian, seasonal patterns)
- Literature review: biological oscillators, coupled systems theory, emergence

### Week 4-6: Experimentation
- Objective: Develop material/sensory interfaces that make cross-scale coupling experienceable
- Sonification: Convert biological signals → sound (MIDI from plants, heartbeat harmonization)
- Visualization: Cymatics with layered frequencies, real-time graphing of phase-locking
- Haptic/kinetic: Physical systems that sync/desync based on input (motorized pendulums, vibrating surfaces)
- Key question: At what threshold does coupling become perceptible to humans?
- Deliverables: 2-3 working prototypes, documentation of successes/failures

### Week 7-8: Design Intervention
- Objective: Create participatory installation that reveals synchronization as it happens
- Installation concept:
* Multi-sensory environment where participants unknowingly become part of the system
* Real-time feedback showing when individual rhythms align into collective pattern
* Scale-bridging: simultaneous display of micro (projected cellular/plant activity) and macro (room full of people) sync
- Technical needs: Sensors, projection/sound system, processing software
- Deliverables: Final installation design, technical specifications

### Week 9-10: Exhibit and Iterate
- Objective: Test with audience, gather insights on how humans respond to made-visible coupling
- Documentation:
* Video of installation in use
* Participant feedback on experience
* Analysis: Did people notice sync? Did awareness change their behavior?
- Final output: Portfolio-ready documentation + reflective essay on findings

### Success Metrics
* [ ] Captured rhythms at 3+ distinct scales
* [ ] Created functional interface that translates invisible coupling into sensory experience
* [ ] Demonstrated emergent synchronization in participatory context
* [ ] Revealed something new about how cross-scale listening works

### Resources Needed
* Bioelectrical sensors (plant, heartbeat monitors)
* Audio equipment + DAW software
* Cymatics setup (speaker, plate, sand/water)
* Projection + computing power
* Access to spaces for observation (natural settings, public spaces)

### Weekly Updates
