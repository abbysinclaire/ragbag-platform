## Seasonal Project: Mathematical Patterns in Music

Investigating how mathematical concepts manifest in musical composition.

### Phase 1: Theory
Reading about:
- Fibonacci sequences in composition
- Fractals in rhythm
- Golden ratio in structure

### Phase 2: Practice
- Composing pieces using mathematical constraints
- Recording and analyzing
- Comparing to traditional compositions

### Current Progress
Working through exercises in *The Geometry of Music* by Dmitri Tymoczko.

Created my first piece using a Fibonacci-based rhythm pattern - it's surprisingly musical!

### Next Steps
- Learn more about spectral music
- Experiment with algorithmic composition
- Maybe build a simple tool to visualize these patterns
