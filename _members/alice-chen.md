## My Seasonal Project: Bio-Inspired Architecture

I'm exploring how natural structures can inform building design.

### Week 1-2: Research Phase
- Studying honeycomb structures
- Looking at termite mounds for ventilation systems
- Reading biomimicry case studies

### Week 3-4: Experimentation
- Creating small-scale models
- Testing different geometric patterns
- Documenting what works and what doesn't

### Goals
- [ ] Build 3 prototype models
- [ ] Write up findings
- [ ] Share with the group

### Resources
- *Biomimicry: Innovation Inspired by Nature* by Janine Benyus
- MIT OpenCourseWare materials
- Local architecture library

### Weekly Updates

#### February 5, 2026
Started looking at hexagonal patterns today. The strength-to-material ratio is fascinating!

#### January 29, 2026
Initial research week. Collecting images and references.
